📱 User App – Fuel Delivery System

💡 Project Background & Motivation
This app was developed as part of a Diploma in Computer Engineering project with a real-world problem in mind. The idea originated from personal and observed experiences involving fuel emergencies, especially during late-night hours.

In many cases, individuals have found themselves stranded at night due to an empty fuel tank—either on highways, isolated roads, or within the city when fuel stations are closed. In such situations:

No fuel stations are open nearby.
It’s unsafe or impossible to leave the vehicle and walk for help.
Assistance may not arrive quickly, especially in remote or low-traffic areas.
Calling a mechanic or friend is often unreliable or not feasible during odd hours.
These real-life incidents inspired the creation of a Fuel Delivery System that would help people avoid getting trapped in emergencies due to low fuel.

🛠️ The Solution – Fuel Delivery System (Rapidfill)
The app offers a modern, safe, and reliable solution to night-time and emergency fuel issues.

This User App allows customers to:
View nearby fuel pumps and their real-time locations on an interactive map.
Check live fuel prices (Petrol and Diesel) updated by the Admin.
Request fuel delivery from the pump directly to their location.
Track delivery status and estimated time of arrival.
Reorder or request services quickly in case of repeated needs.
The app connects users with registered delivery personnel who bring fuel from authorized pumps.

🚚 How Transfer Fuel
Unlike some temporary or informal fuel services that deliver fuel in cans or bottles (which are unsafe and sometimes illegal), this app is designed with safety, scalability, and compliance in mind.

🔐 Future Implementation Goals
To ensure this system is safe, legal, and scalable, we plan to:

Design a special fuel container that ensures:
Leak-proof and fire-resistant properties
Real-time GPS tracking of the container
Tamper-proof locks for added security
Approved standards for transporting fuel safely

Equip delivery personnel not just with fuel but with basic vehicle support tools, including:

Tire replacement kits
Battery jump-start tools
Basic vehicle diagnostics

Recruit skilled delivery agents who:

Are trained in vehicle troubleshooting
Know road safety protocols
Can assist users during breakdowns

This transforms the system from just fuel delivery to a comprehensive roadside emergency support service.

🌍 Vision
If implemented across fuel stations in cities and rural areas, this system can:

Reduce the number of stranded vehicles
Prevent night-time emergencies
Enhance the safety and convenience of travelers
Create employment opportunities for trained delivery agents
